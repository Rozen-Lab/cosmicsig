Description: Mutational signatures from COSMIC (the Catalogue Of Somatic
    Mutations In Cancer) <https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/>.
    The name cosmicsig stands for COSMIC signatures. This is a data package 
    with 2 main package variables: signature and etiology. The signature
    variable contains the latest mutational signature profiles released
    on COSMIC for 4 mutation types:
     * SBS (single base substitutions in the context of preceding and 
     following bases,
     * Strand bias SBS: SBSs from transcribed regions (exons and 
     introns), that take into into consideration the transcriptional 
     strand,
     * DBS (doublet base substitutions),
     * ID (small insertions and deletions)
    The etiology package variable provides the known or hypothesied 
    causes of signatures. Please run ?cosmicsig for more information.
