Description: A data package with 2 main package variables: 'signature' and 'etiology'. 
     The 'signature' variable contains the latest mutational signature profiles released
     on COSMIC <https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/> for 4 mutation types:
     * SBS (single base substitutions in the context of preceding and following bases),
     * Strand bias SBS: SBSs from transcribed regions (exons and introns), 
     that take into consideration the transcriptional strand,
     * DBS (doublet base substitutions),
     * ID (small insertions and deletions)
    The 'etiology' variable provides the known or hypothesized causes of signatures. 
    'cosmicsig' stands for COSMIC signatures. Please run ?'cosmicsig' for more information.
